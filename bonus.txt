In the project CC3k, we have added the following features:
1. We used vectors instead of arrays and shared pointers instead of raw pointers in our entire implementation.
2. We added different colors to enemies, items and PC when printing to the screen.
3. We added the “welcome” screen, “lose” screen, “win” screen and “byebye” screen when the player just enters the game, loses the game, wins the game and quits the game respectively.
4. We added another type of enemy – Midterm (E), and another type of player character – Student, so that when student gets attacked by midterm, the student dies right away. Implementing such feature only needs to type in “dlc” in the command line when running the program.
5. We provide three types of command line options, including adding default map, choosing seed(must be greater than 0) to randomly generate character and items, and adding DLC.
  -  To  add default map: type in valid file name
  -  To use seed for srand(), type in any integer greater than 0
  -  To use DLC, type in “dlc” (must be lower case, otherwise unrecognized)
